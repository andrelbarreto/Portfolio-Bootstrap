# Homework-Repos
All NU Bootcamp repos containing homework assignments and projects will be found within this folder.

The first is a Portfolio showcasing my skills being built during Northwestern U Coding Bootcamp. In it you will find links to my projects, as well as more information about myself and my goals within the industry.

This Portfolio Repository starts with a bio page built using HTML and CSS Bootstrap.
It allows interface with menu for more information in About me, to fill out contact forms under Contact, or to take a look at my portfolio as it grows during the course of the next few months.

It is effectively the first assignment for the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp and will constantly be updated.  Eventualy it will contain a portfolio with several projects linked to main page showcasing not only my skills in full stack web development but also how I apply my several years of expertise in Communications, Marketing and Digital Marketing to them.
